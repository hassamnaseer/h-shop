              H-Shop is an e-commerce portfolio project by <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/hassamnaseer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hassam Naseer</a>.
              H-Shop is developed in React JS with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Firebase</a> support for authorization(Login/Signup) and to store products and images.
              <br /><br />
              This Single Page Application is developed using best programming practices, optimization and true essence of React JS. This project is developed in a way that with just a minor changes,
              it can be used as a ready to go project for anyone.
              <br /><br />
              As this is just a sort of demo project, there was no need for making a checkout component. This component can easily be made as it just requires a form and some email service without backend like EmailJS or can be made in Express as well.

              As this is just a portfolio project so I had to use images from another website. I used images and product names from <a href="https://fadano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fadano</a>.<br /><br />
              In the Home page (sale section), I used this <a href='https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/watercolor' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watercolor vector created by freepik - www.freepik.com</a>.<br /><br />
              As for the carousel images and some other pages top backgrounds, I used images which are all as follows:<br /><br />
